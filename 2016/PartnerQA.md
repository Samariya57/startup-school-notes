## Y Combinator Partner Q&A

**If you know you eventually want to start a startup, when do you do it? How do you navigate the tradeoff of being a domain expert, versus just starting now?**

If you want to start a company, you should start now. Of course, once you start, you should try to become a domain expert as soon as possible.

If you don't have an idea, join a hot startup for a couple years, get a good idea of what a well-run startup looks like, so when you do start you're already ahead of the game.

**What does a good idea look like?**

Look at your lives, your family, your work, and find problems that interest you. Think about what you want the first ilne of your Wikipedia article will be – every startup has the potential to be your life's work.

Sometimes people come up with ideas that seem impressive to other people – to make it sound fancy, to use buzzwords – but a better way to do it is to find something you're deeply passionate about, that you're excited about.

**How do you choose between an idea that you love but might be impossible to monetize, and a product that has great revenue potential?**

How do you know that?

**Do you have any advice for solo founders?**

All things equal, it's better to have a cofounder, but YC has accepted many companies with solo founders – just come with something that's very unique to you, such as traction, unique insights on how to acquirer/retain users, just know your shit. Come across as very competent.

Startups are hard for two founders, three founders, everybody. So coming in as a solo founder means you must be superhuman, able to build your product, sell your product, talk to customers, everything.

Starting a company i san emotional rollercoaster, and it's really hard to do by yourself. It's always nice when someone next to you feels the same pain, someone you can commiserate with.

How Gobble got in: Ooshma never gives up, never stops fighting until it works. You want to be a cockroach – Airbnb almost failed three times as well before they got things up and running.

**What are some resources out there that can help?**

Set up your company with the help of services like Clerky for paperwork, Gusto for payroll, Ironclad to store your NDAs, sales contracts, etc. Don't try to reinvent the wheel; use all your brainpower to figure out how to build your product and make your company grow.

**Is there anything you find really early stage founders wasting a lot of time on?**

Funky voting structures, weird vesting schedules, trying to protect themselves for some unknown company that's going to come in and steal all their ideas. You don't need to worry about these things in the early days; just keep it simple. If things come up later, you can afford to pay lawyers to help you fix them then.

Being secretive and trying to protect your idea. The more common problem is that you'll tell your idea to 100 people, and they will shrug their shoulders and not care. Sometimes it's valuable to tell your idea to anyone who will listen, in case you can get some key insight.

**How should startups look at competition?**

Track what they're doing, but don't copy – sometimes their failures may be caused by simple mistakes that you can avoid.

**Is it better to move fast or perfect your product?**

It's not a binary thing – 99.9% of the time, the answer's "both". Life is a lot of grey area. It's often just someone wanting permission to not work on the thing they don't want ot work on.

If you find yourself with this kind of dichotomies (e.g. revenue vs. passion), it's always good to zoom out, realize life isn't black and white and isn't zero sum decisions. Get to the root of what you're concerned about, what you want to solve for.

If you have a retention problem in your product, don't spend a lot of time on PR. Don't try to grow really fast when people aren't sticking around.

In the early days, acquiring users shows that it's something people want, but you should always have a metric/threshold (retention, NPS) that once it gets below a certain point, then stop focusing on growth – ask why it's there, how to improve it.

**For a startup that's recently launched, what's a good growth rate?**

How long have you been working on this project, and am I impressed with what you've done? The growth rate is very dependent on business, and so a better way to think about it is to be super intellectually honest with yourself; thinking about how long you've worked on it compared to other people and judging if what you've done is impressive.

**What do you look for when reading YC applications? What do you look for when interviewing companies?**

Do they have unique insight on how they will acquire customers? Can they communicate their ideas in a very brief manner, so I understand it?

Be biased towards people who are action-oriented and actually do stuff – a very large percentage of people who want to start a company haven't done anything; they treat the application as asking permission to quit their job and work on it. On the other hand, there's people like Ooshma who have a website, have customers, are more action-oriented. If you've made a thing, showed it to people, and gotten money for what you've made, then it makes your application infinitely better.

Can we get to the end of the application and actually understand what the company is doing? It's helpful if you don't bury the lead – don't wait til the end to say your growth/revenue numbers; you can put that as early as possible.

The only way you can know if you'll get into YC is to apply. 40% of last batch had no prior contact with YC.

**At what point should a company apply? Is there an optimal time?**

Keep on applying.

There is no too early, there is no too late – YC can be helpful to companies at all stages.

**Any particular helpful advice that you've gotten that you'd like to pass on?**

Wish someone had told me it's as rewarding as it ended up being – unbelievably rewarding because it's so hard, and to get through it and be successful at it at many different levels were som eof the best experiences of my life.

Let go of being in the nitty-gritty so much; as the company grows, learn to let go. Know what you should be managing and what your priorities should be.

Ask for more help. Especially in Silicon Valley, people are incredibly willing to help.

Don't rest on your laurels, even when you start to see success.

In most jobs in life, you have to conform to someone else's culture; in your startup, you get to choose everything – who you work with, what you work on, what your work style is. So create your own reality that best serves your own ideas. Stop reading all these blog posts and do it your own way.

Don't be afraid to talk to people about bad things that happen – it can really help to take the load off; you can feel like you're not constantly acting, not constantly being the startup founder that everything's going well for.
