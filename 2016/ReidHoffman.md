## Reid Hoffman – LinkedIn, Greylock

*Tell us something you believe to be true that very few people agree with you on.*

This question always has to be indexed against the population. We have an extremely high likelihood in the next 50-100 years that we create another cognitive species, one with similar or superior intelligence to us. Not just AI, but a new species that's not *Homo sapiens*. It's conditioned on breakthroughs in AI (truly generalized AI).

*Tell us something you believe to be true that very few people in this room agree with you on.*

One thing that's important when inventing products is a fairly deep sense and understanding of human nature and humanity – being able to articulate a robust theory of what is human nature, where is humanity right now and where it's going. Reid has said before he's interested in investing in one of the Seven Deadly Sins.

*Everyone talks about trying to avoid mistakes, but what are things you should do to become really great?*

One thing is to build the strongest possible network around you. Ask your network why your idea is good, why the idea could fail, etc.

Think about whether your idea will be sufficient to break through the noise – find some way to grow on a particular platform, or have a particular way to get good growth into your product (virality, SEO, etc).

*What are the early signs of a product that is able to break through the noise?*

Once you see traction, you still have questions – how far will the traction go – but it actually answers a bunch of those. Are people engaging, are people re-engaging, how do people discover it?

The challenging thing is how to come up with these theories beforehand. Understanding human nature helps here: why is it viral, why will it grow?  
- For consumer, there's always some theory along with some idea of how distribution works that you're applying. People will do the following activities, which will cause people to discover this app/site/service.  
- On the enterprise side, clear match with traditional enterprise techniques are what matters.

The most classic problem is, *I've got a cool idea for which there's no unique product*, which is insufficient. It doesn't address how your distribution will work. If you don't see a path to $100M/year revenue, and have good growth after that, you have zero chance of being a standalone successful company.

You're hunting for the earliest possible proof of whether you're on the right track – working from day 1 on the MVP to test your idea.

*Seems like great founders don't give up too early – can you lose a lot of great companies if people give up too early?*

Flexible persistence is important – being willing to react and respond to external ideas and input, but also having the conviction to stick to your guns once you've tested whether the external ideas are valid or not. Before deciding to pivot, look for 2-3 separate points that reduce your confidence.

*How do you raise money from Greylock?*

Intro is really important – he gets 50-60 unsolicited decks in his email a day. Warm intros from people he trusts work well, as well as ideas that are seriously unique.

It doesn't have to be the only thing in its field, but if there are too many other players, it needs to be well differentiated. What is the thing that will uniquely make you very big?

Greylock can only do one investment in each space, and so they do a lot of research in picking the right one. They then throw a bunch of resources at it – great recruiting practices, etc.

*WHat did the founder of Convoy do to convince you they're the best for regional trucking?*

The founder came in through a great referral, and during the first discussion, he got a strong impression that the founders truly understood the space, the market, how it's a very different network from the Uber network, what the challenges would be. They had clearly thought about it and had a story.

Rather than saying you're guaranteed to be successful, show that you understand the risks and have measured the risks. Show that you understand the game in front of you and can parse it the right way.

*Do you need a deck?*

You don't need a deck, but it's good to have at least a lightweight one (10-15 slides) opening with the hypotheses driving this investment thesis, 7-8 bullets long, with the rest of the slides giving info that backs up those bullets. Look at the LinkedIn Series B deck online.

Have a sketch of what the business will look like as a big company – we'll charge people like this, this is why the product will be good, this is why we'll charge good margins, this is why we'll have a defensible position, this is why we'll be a big size.

To claim zero competition is usually not credible; it's better to say, here's how the competition has a different angle of attack than I do, and here's why mine will work better.

*What is a return on a $500M fund that is okay?*

A $2-3B gross is okay – not the 10x growth that every top firm has hit, but acceptable.

*How do you scale a company?*

Watch the Blitzscaling class online: first mover meets first to scale. It's not the first out of the gate, but the first to scale.

Comfort for investors and entrepreneurs is to completely figure out product-market fit, your distribution and revenue model, then scale – that only works when you're doing it completely by yourself, with no competitors. But more often than not, you have part of that story right, but have intense enough competition you have to decide to scale sooner.

One of the key things of Blitzscaling is that startups will spend a bunch of capital at less efficiency than you would typically think (e.g. Uber), which is a decision based on offense and defense – establishing yourself, getting network effects early, etc.

Read *Built to Scale*; learn how each of customer acquisition, revenue model, support model, servicing model, growing your company can help you grow your scale globally. The thing that makes really big businesses are the ones that can scale.

*Which direction do you see entrepreneurs making in 2016? Are they doing it too early or too late?*

Doing it too late is due to asking too many questions, trying to have confident answers in too many things, etc.  
Doing it too early is to not have asked the correct questions, was too scared of a competitor, and released a product that was quite not working yet.

*One of the challenges we've seen the most when scaling quickly is to find enough good people to hire, and to preserve your company culture – any thoughts?*

Part of how you scale a culture is keeping everyone accountable – it's not hierarchical, not just the founders saying what to do, but everyone must act that way. Reid Hastings would say we're not a family, we're a sports team. Not lifetime loyalty, but instead ensure we're all performing. When it comes time to evaluate performance, be willing to let poor performers go.

Hiring: using networks have a bias problem, especially as diversity makes you stronger, but you can use your networks in the right way to promote diversity. Also, definitely do reference checks. Most people are good at seeing coherent and reasonable in a couple of interactions; the real question is how the person works for weeks, months, years in the trenches. Send a note to people: "Sam, rate 1-10" – the weak answers are usually 7, 7.5, which mean "I wanna say bad things but I won't", but if you get a 10, verify that the candidate is one of the best people they've ever worked with, and if you have a blend of them, it means you should engage.

When you're hiring executives, you need to spend much more time together (20-40 hours even) to figure out how you can work together, how your problem solving techniques align, can you align on things you want to accomplish.
