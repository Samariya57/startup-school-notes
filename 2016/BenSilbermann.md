## Ben Silbermann – Founder, Pinterest

**Who was Ben before Pinterest? What interested you growing up, through college, and after?**

Growing up in Des Moines, Iowa, Ben always thought he was going to be a doctor. At Yale, he was pre-med and didn't really have a specific plan except just that, but it never felt quite right.

College was the first time he had his own laptop with high speed internet, which was a really transformative experience – he fell in love with the Internet. Afterwards, however, he took a job at a consulting firm mainly because it was offered to him.

**As someone not technical, how did you learn to start a tech company?**

You end up learning little bits at a time, and it's always easier to learn things when you have something to build, rather than in just an abstract way.

**When and how did you decide to quit your job and commit fully to a startup company?**

Didn't think he knew enough to start a company, but thought maybe the first step was to work at a company he admired, so he moved to the West Coast and joined Google. Still noodled on ideas and prototypes on the side, but his girlfriend at the time gave him the push he needed to quit his day job and pursue his ideas full time.

After seeing the iPhone announcement, thought it was an incredible – first idea was taking the catalogs in your mailbox and put it on your iPhone, starting a company called Tote. Tried to raise money, but it was a total shitshow. It was 2008, the economy had collapsed, and attitudes at investor meetings was "why are you even here?" Couldn't raise money, even after calling everyone who they could have called. Was finally able to obtain funding after getting 2nd place at a startup competition.

Thinking more about toys, him and his cofounder came up with the simple idea behind Pinterest.

**What was the problem you were trying to solve?**

They thought it would be cool for themselves at first. Having a tool to collect things for yourself would be really useful, and give you a window to someone else's world. It seemed like a really fun product to have.

Upon release, it wasn't a runaway success, but what kept them going was a really cool product that they enjoyed and were convinced others would enjoy too.

**How did you find your first users?**

They released it, emailed all their friends, but no one really got it (though they were polite): "It's *very* interesting..."

Certain folks really loved it – not the typical early adopters, but those who used it to collect the food and normal things in their life. The team went to some conferences with bloggers who they thought fit that archetype, and pushed hard to get their early users through the bloggers.

They did some pretty desperate things in the beginning – Ben would stand in the Apple Store, open Pinterest in all the computers, then comment from the back "Wow, this Pinterest thing..."

Since it took so long to get users, they cared about them so much – Ben would take customer support calls, send customer support emails.

Two lessons:

(1) the stereotype that early adopters are technology-forward folks doesn't apply anymore; everyone has computers in their pocket and so it could be taxi drivers, people at home. Being dogmatic and wanting the Silicon Valley type people to like them probably wouldn't have worked for them.

(2) Really take care of your customers

What people say they want and what people mean can sometimes be different. A very common thing to ask people was "Why don't you try to create a board, try to pin something?" Right before, would ask "What do you expect to see by clicking that", and afterwards go over whether it matched what they expected. Get user feedback for sure, but use your judgment to decide what parts of the product you really want to invest in. Now Pinterest has researchers that go all over the world to do that kind of work, and they run experiments and get data, but at the end you still have to use your judgment.

**How long did it take until you thought you were onto something that could be really big?**

There wasn't really one moment – they were growing every month, and it wasn't until they went out to raise more money (as a tool to grow the business) that they were forced to say how big they thought it would be.

Ben had a dual feeling: the idea that it couldn't be something really grand, but people around him like investors who were convinced that it could.

Now wants to build the world's catalog of ideas – raising the bar on what the company can be, attracting people who can be more creative and ambitious in solving big problems.

**How did you finance the company initially, as you were pivoting from Tote to Pinterest?**

Team was really small, burn rate was really low – small team of 5, worked at someone's place, brought their own computers. Didn't know how long it would take, so they were trying to be as resourceful as possible.

Fundraising hasn't ever been a goal; more of a tool to get the next step. Recently people have confused money – the tool – with the goal. Money shouldn't the goal; the goal is to build the product and service that you want.

**Can you talk about your quote: When trying to attract people to your startup, they don't want the guarantee of success, but the guarantee of adventure?**

The first engineer they hired was from Craigslist.

As they got momentum, they tried to use their assets as much as possible – and one of their few assets was their apartment in Palo Alto. They hosted barbeques every week (had people bring their own food), but it was a great way to recruit the right kind of people, the builders, the ones who tended to be curious about a ton of different things but deep in something.

One of their early engineers built magic tricks and crazy games in his garage; another drew cartoons. Many were almost outsiders to technology, which has served them really well as a company.

**Are you still trying to solve the same problems today with Pinterest as you were initially trying to solve?**

A lot of the ambitions are the same, but the scope is very different.

Today, the idea of building a catalog of ideas has also evolved. What if there was one place where everyone published their ideas? One that understood you so well it would surface the exact ideas you want? Can it help you discover what is right for yourself, instead of just an objective answer like Google?

One of the great perks in starting a company is you get to hire all these people who are way better than you in these areas: computer vision engineers, etc.

**What was your moment of greatest discouragement, your lowest point?**

There were so many. Everyone has real moments of self-doubt; Ben can think of a whole bunch of times this happened: trying to shard their database with 3 engineers, faced with the fear of losing everyone's data forever.

They got to the point they did by making a series of mistakes. Facebook has a sign saying "Move fast and break things"; though that mentality took a long time to adopt. It's important as the leader of a company to make your employees feel like they can try things without fear.

**How did you develop your skills in running a company?**

Early investor Kevin Kartz was one of the first people who really took time to help them through things.

The biggest risk of a startup is the founders becoming so discouraged they burn out, but if you go into it saying "survive or die", tying your personal self-worth to the company, it increases the chance of that happening. Now people can ask others who have gone through similar things for tips on how to avoid.

One of Ben's core jobs is to learn as fast as he can, both by trying and failing and by talking to people.

**How did your job change over the years?**

Some parts are the same and some are different.

The founders are always responsible for driving clarity in what you're building and why; what's the standard culturally and objectively for the types of people you want to bring in.

A job that changes is building your organization through people who can do it better than you can, while making sure that they are doing it the way you have thought about it. You get better at communicating, at managing people.

Initially, Ben was introverted to the point of not replying to press requests, which of course is not a great decision.

**How involved are you with the product today?**

Right now Ben is still involved with the product, but now generally tries to ask the right questions and gets the team to pursue the right ideas.

Have faith in the people you hire who are closer to the problem, the people you have hired because they have great judgment, and empower them to solve the problem.

**About culture at an organization: how do you build it from a tiny thing to what it is now? What is the glue that binds?**

When you're small, culture kind of creates itself.

Wnated people to be obsessed with users of their service – every decision was based on what's really best for pinners.

The more diverse backgrounds of people they hire, the better the product will be. You are the sum of all your experiences, so when you build a product, you value engineering, you valud design, you value marketing. Fight the natural inertia to hire people like yourself, not just because it's a nice thing to do, but because you will build better products if you knit all those ideas together.
