## YC Office Hours with Qasar Younis & Kevin Hale

Marketplaces have very high potential and much investor interest, and have some similar characteristics and themes: supply and demand, etc.

What are the bottlenecks to growth? As a founder, there are an infinite number of problems you could be focusing on, but bottlenecks to growth are a nice true north.

**Traveling Spoon**

*Food and travel marketplace, connecting travelers with local, authentic food experiences: home-cooked meals, cooking classes, market tours. At the moment, most travelers find out about them through word of mouth, some press, or channel partners (tour operators, trip planners).*

What are the conditions of the two sides you're trying to grow; how are they being connected? What is supply, what is demand? What is the rate of growth for each of those?

Why are you in so many countries? Why did you choose Cambodia, etc. Why breadth vs. depth? There are a large amount of tour operators in individual countries already (e.g. Thailand).

How much of your revenue is from channels, how much is word of mouth?

What are you guys most worried about? How do you get to travelers at the point of the decision making process?

The direct model may not make sense, as people don't travel often and would have to, every time, find this product all over again. There are two categories of products people use: (1) something you use every day, like checking the news or Facebook, or (2) something that answers a mental query, like Google Maps. Feels like the product is in category (2), but it's so infrequent it may be lost in people's minds.

Why not focus on channel partners? Don't let the nice idea of becoming like Airbnb, a hub for travel, cause you to choose an ineffective business. You need consistent growth above all – word of mouth and having a product that people recall takes a long, long time.

Where are the most power hungry users in the system?

There are two types of companies that Kevin gets excited about: (1) the startup that everyone glorifies, grows quickly and shoots up; (2) a company that has slower growth, but has potential to last 20 years. If the core idea is that when you travel, you have an incredible experience, it'll be extremely valuable.

**Humansurge**

*Global roster for aid workers, connecting disaster areas immediately with professionals or volunteers adept at working in crisis situations. Founded as a social for-profit enterprise, charging non profits to have access to a list of workers.*

Are you a non profit? Why a marketplace? How does the business model work?

Going through the website:

- How do you quickly understand what the company does? Couldn't find a simple copy paste sentence anywhere on the website. Don't use words like "single platform" that mean very different things to different people.

- There's a giant Beta label on the website that makes you not want to sign up – how does this have anything to do with a disaster? People make mistakes; there's nothing you can do to manage expectations except just be very responsive to questions and mistakes. You don't need a Beta logo for that. It's a good problem to have so many users that you're getting issue reports from them.

- Don't have buttons for each side of the marketplace on one page (Join as Professional, Join as Organization). Even Airbnb etc. focus on a single side of the marketplace – for these guys, it should be organizations.

- Call to actions are on the very bottom of the page, below a giant map, large pricing plans, etc. For users who have never heard of them before, it's asking for a lot. Make it easier to sign up.

- Search form is not how people usually do it – don't use an interface no one has used before, as your users won't know wtf they are doing.

Don't have to build in an entire search engine to test a product like this. Just be like "tell us what kind of volunteer you want, when you need it, and we'll get in contact with you".

A lot of founders don't realize the need to get to the point quickly – the first exposure their customers have to the site should direct them as simply as possible through the sign up flow.

**Powr of You**

*Help people take control of their data, starting by monetizing consumers through market research. Supply is the data from consumers, demand is from brands.*

Why would I want to do this as a consumer? What percentage of total users are actually getting paid, and how much have you paid out the last six months? (8% of people, about $3000)

What is your biggest problem right now? (Sales cycle to brands)

What does your sales cycle look like? (2 months up to 6 months, sometimes drops out)

Do you have enough supply to entice the brands? (Yes, in the areas we are targeting heavily)

If I'm, say, Pepsi, and I come to you, what is my normal payout, what does a normal contract look like? How many people do I get for the $50k?

How often are you closing a big business? How long does it take to close? How many people do you have in the pipeline? How many people do you email per day? (a whole 3 people per week?!)

Need to be contacting like a hundred people a day. If it takes 6 months, everything you do right now directly feeds into that. Many people want to have multiple touch points (e.g. key decision maker), but the first touch point should be just a simple email – I'm a founder, want to talk to someone about my product – to find low hanging fruit. The only way to find low hanging fruit is to reach out to as many people as possible.

At this stage, there's not a lot of value in finding specific brands and specific decision makers; rather, it's to get information about what people want. I see this company, they like us, now it's time to find thousands of companies just like it. Your first 100-200 customers could be something as unexpected as hospitals, etc.

Sometimes the truth is *just* out of your reach. At first, you need to be very skeptical of your assumptions. Email everyone, track your open rate, track your conversion, signups, etc – if you're competing someone with a huge sales force, the only way to compete is to leverage modern tech and sales tools to reach as many people as possible.

Website has lots of dimensions and graphs – but the only thing consumers care about is that $65
