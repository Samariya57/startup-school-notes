## Chad Rigetti – Founder, Rigetti Computing

When they joined YC in the summer of 2014, they had nothing but a general idea of how to build a qubit. Now, two years later, they are building quantum computers, in a race to define the technology for the next 20, 30, 40 years.

Humans have built tools and tech to store information for millenia – from the sundial to the abacus, the Babbage difference engine, to punch cards – all systems based on Newtonian mechanics. Every time we have a deeper understanding of nature, our way of storing information has evolved as well.

IBM, Fairchild, Intel helped transition from punch cards to microchips, and it has driven the global economy for 50, 60 years. We've known since 1905 that there's a more fundamental depiction of nature than Newton's laws and Maxwell's equations – quantum mechanics – and Rigetti computing wants to lead the next transition using those principles.

Why? One bucket is quantum chemistry, which can lead to better catalysts, better materials, better medicines – solve global warming. The other is quantum machine learning – learn on classically intractable physical models, create fundamentally more powerful forms of AI.

Our current approach to building large-scale computers is starting to break, for two reasons: (1) Moore's law has leveled off the last 8 years; (2) Amdahl's law describes the limits of parallelization – we're using computers now with 1.2 million cores, others that are half the size of a football field and require nuclear power plants to power them.

Quantum physics has a faster, cheaper path to computing power. A single chip with 60-70 qubits on it will be more powerful than that half-football-field-sized machine.

At Yale, Chad worked with a group that combined superconducting qubits with integrated circuits, and now has started Rigetti Computing to build quantum integrated circuits.
Quantum computers store and process information in individual photons. An iPhone 7 uses 10^17 photons per bit transmitted – this is far more efficient technology.

This is a true hard tech startup, and one of the challenges of true hard tech companies is operating in an arena that's not well defined, doesn't have a well-defined supply chain. They've had to develop all the building blocks – entire supply chains for the technology – by themselves. Their own fab, their own chip design, their own control electronics, their own software and applications.

What's the difference between a hard tech company and a traditional company? Hard tech doesn't just feel harder – the risks are different. Tech companies have tech, execution, and market risk; a hard tech company has to not only address these issues, but also deal with fundamental questions of possibility. Is it even possible?

Why the hell would anyone invest in your company when it might not be even possible? Why is it worth it? Because if and when you are successful, you create monumental leverage and defensibility along with incredible passion. The Manhattan project and Apollo missions were canonical hard tech projects; look at the leverage they created. Even tech companies like Uber, Google, Microsoft are pursuing hard tech now.

Building an organization that has world experts in X, Y, Z is incredibly hard. You're going to have to interface to the best scientists and engineers on the planet in many diverse fields, bring them all into the same company, and impedance match – enable them to talk to each other. But this integration becomes a long term weapon for your organization.

Think long and hard about how you communicate. Rigetti Computing's mission is to `Build the world's most powerful computers to help solve humanity's most important and pressing problems` – something you can really sink your teeth into, something more tangible than moving photons around. it will be your rallying cry, something that really ties together your organization.

Rigetti is full stack: Chip -> System -> Software Platform -> Applications & Services – IBM + Intel + Microsoft + Google all in one.

As yourself: What kind of company do I want to join or found?
When you do that, some of you will realize you want to do the thing that calls to you, that's worth spending your life on.

As a founder and a leader, there's always a tension between product and company development:
*Product development:* Drive product from concept to market.
*Company development:* Build capabilities and create organizational clarity.

Both are processes of removing entropy, of pumping entropy out of the vision. Balance these competing tensions using this principle; use it especially when you decide who to hire. Some people are adept are reducing entropy, of making better systems, of making systems that are easier to use and support. Others just generate entropy. Make sure you hire the right people.

In a lot of hard tech organizations, a very small number of people outcompete everyone – the world's most powerful computer in 1953 was built in the woods of Wisconsin by 34 people.

Sam: it's so easy to see someone like Chad, and be like "that was so mindblowing; I can't ever be like that person" – but it was not that long ago that Chad wasn't sure he wanted to start a company at all, if it had any chance of working at all. It's amazing seeing how the people giving these talks now have changed over the years.
