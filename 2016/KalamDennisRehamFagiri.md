## Kalam Dennis & Reham Fagiri – AptDeco

Built a great business (a "Real Business") by working hard month after month, staying scrappy, creating an actually profitable business – every month, they have more money in their bank account.

How do you do this?

**(1) Get from 0 to 1**

Getting from no customers to getting that first customer is not so easy. Both founders had corporate backgrounds, knowing how to get from 1000 to 2000 – YC was what helped them tame the completely different animal that is 0 to 1.

How AptDeco got from 0 to 1: they initially trolled Craigslist, emailing people to get listings. Out of 100 they emailed, only 10 actually listed. Their YC partner, Kevin Hale, suggested AptDeco list it for sellers without their knowledge – you're doing them a favor – and immediately AptDeco had buyers. After trying emails with little success, the founders then took a bag of cash around the city to do pickups, sometimes even leaving cash first, telling the sellers to also sign up for AptDeco. At the same time, it gave them significant insight into their customers.

When you're starting a business, forget advertising on Facebook/Twitter/whatever. Find scrappy, free ways to see if your product works, if it's something customers will respond to.

**(2) Don't be married to a path**

Don't be afraid if your vision changes. Let your customers dictate what your business should be, versus what you think it needs to be. Embrace change.

When AptDeco first started, they focused on just being a platform, never touching the furniture; just a nice, neat, clean facilitator. Plugging into other moving companies' excess capacity ended up not working – prices went up; quality of service went down. They were forced to do the deliveries themselves one day 8 months in, and customers responded to it, calling in to say it was the best moving experience they've ever had. After some co-founder back and forth, they compromised on a "man in a van" solution with private van owners, which again didn't work.

Finally, they landed on having their own trucks, own delivery folk, and it was instrumental to their business – cut costs, improved customer experience, completely changed the dynamic of their business. Delivery suddenly was a delightful experience, and word of mouth ended up accounting for 60% of their business.

**(3) Become default alive**

Paul Graham has a great essay asking if you are default alive or default dead. Default alive is if you have enough money in the bank to cover your expenses, even if you never raise another dollar again. Are you growing fast enough to cover your expenses?

AptDeco was only focused on growth for a while, ignoring profitability, but then couldn't raise money. They had work without any investment – so cut costs, cut their marketing $ to zero, increased costs in areas where it was unsustainable – and finally go to the point they are today.

Always be aware of your bottom line – it's easy for expenses to get away from you as you grow your business. They look at their expenses every month, compare how much they charge with how much they spend.

**(4) Ignore the noise**

Is this a bubble? Is it easy to fundraise or not? There's lots of chatter out there, but try to completely ignore the noise and just focus on your business.

They had a competitor with 20x the funding, hundreds of employees, all over the news, and thinking about that competitor all the time really distracted them from building a real business, talking to customers, getting good word of mouth – but the competitor ended up folding, making all of the time spent thinking a waste.

Who decides what's going to last? Your customers. Block your brain, get to profitability.

If you know better, you do better.
