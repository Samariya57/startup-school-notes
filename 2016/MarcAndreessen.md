## Marc Andreessen – Founder, a16z

*How did you decide after starting a bunch of companies to become an investor? How is a16z different from other firms?*

VC had become professionalized, but started to stray away from keeping the founders in favor of professional CEOs with business & sales experience. Marc and Ben knew that some of the best companies in history were run by their founders – IBM, Hewlett Packard – and were convinced of the model of a founder-CEO.

a16z was founded with a focus on two things:  
(1) All of their general partners have built and run companies before, who have gone through the struggle (or the "shit").  
(2) Give founders "superpowers"; giving the ability to be like a professional CEO to a founder who hasn't ever been in that position before. This generally involves a network: business associates, regulators, etc. You "plug into the Matrix" and get a big upgrade as soon as you're in.

*Did you think about this back in 2015/2016, or has it evolved?*

It's definitely evolved, but the core idea was there from the beginning. a16z was a startup, and they were big fans of thinking it through and having a differentiated strategy.

*Lots of first time founders in the audience. Raising money is sort of a black box; what's the specific process you use?*

Firstly, a16z thinks about what bucket the company is in:  
(1) All pre-seed/seed/seed extension/etc rounds are treated as one bucket.  
(2) Have raised a formal, $10-15M Series A (especially one from firms that have a formalized process)

A warm referral is just a test – the ability to network your way to a VC firm can be indicative of your ability to network your way to your first customer, to the best employees, etc. If you're connected to YC, you're already plugged in; if you're not, you need to find a way to become connected.

There's an argument for an entrepreneur only spending time with junior partners at a firm, focusing solely on the senior partners who are the actual decision makers. However, oftentimes it's hard to fully convince a senior partner from a standing start; instead, try to network into the firm through a junior partner, figure out how your ideas and approach will be received, then work your way through the firm. These days this initial phase take around 2 weeks – in cold environments like 2003, it could have been up to six months.

Afterwards, you have the Monday partners' meeting with a formal presentation, which is another test – as a founder, are you good enough as a CEO to get up for 60 minutes and talk about your business? Can you successfully execute a formal pitch? It should be easy; VC firms are actually incentivized to give out money to good companies; your customers and engineers will be a default no.

If you've passed those two tests, then comes term sheets and negotiation and the other stuff.

*How many checks do you write a year?*

~20 A/B stage investments per year – around 1% of warm referrals.

*How do you know an investor is actually good as a first-time founder?*

Five key ways:  
(1) References  
(2) References  
(3) References  
(4) References  
(5) References

The Valley is super networked so it's easy.

*What does it mean to find a reference?*

Front-door references: ask "who should I talk to?"; you get a list of people who will (hopefully) just say good things about the person.

Back-door references: people who have worked with that investor before, people who have been funded by them, or even other investors. Generally more valuable.

*What should I listen to on a first reference check that's the "double talk" of "this is not a good investor?"*

If you get anything other than "this guy is awesome, I'd love to have him on my board" – especially if you get silences – then run. Many people don't want to say bad things about people, so they say nothing committal, e.g. "this guy is very punctual".

It's an incredibly useful skill if you learn how; test it out on investors and it'll be helpful when you're hiring as well.

*Lots of founders look up to you; who do you look up to?*

Silicon Valley has a tendency to think that we don't have anything to learn from the people before us – but Marc thinks that the people who were successful in the past had it harder than we have it now, and so they were likely better.

Books to read:  
- *The Maverick and his Machine*, the origin story of IBM (about Thomas Watson Sr., an absolute terror who built an extraordinary company)  
- *Bill and Dave* about HP  
- *The Wizard of Menlo Park* about Edison and the 2nd Industrial Revolution  
- *I Invented the Modern Age* about Ford  
- *Da Vinci's Robots*  
- *The Lunar Men* about James Watt and the Lunar Society

There is a repeating pattern of the world is the way it is, people take it for granted, but a group of people take on the hard task of transforming society.

*There is such an echo chamber of opinions in the Valley; every opinion has a counter-opinion. How do you know what's actually true?*

There's no silver bullet, just lead bullets – you just have to do all the work, and most of the work is just grinding labor for which there is no substitute.

*What's in store in the next 2 years in the startup ecosystem?*

Things are starting to work – the Internet works, smartphones work, new social platforms and marketplaces, enterprise technology, developer adoption. Of course, not everything's working; there's always a power law curve with few big successes and a long tail of failures. But the things that are working are working really well – and the big things that work are platforms on top of which other things can be built.

There is a repeating cycle of things starting to work interspersed with things being built on top of those things – e.g. now there's AI, machine learning, autonomous air/land/sea vehicles, etc. Part of a16z's job is to track those fields and investigate startups in those fields, constantly trying to map and understand all the companies and founders trending in these areas.

Marc doesn't think any VC does a great job of predicting these things – for a company to succeed, the right people and the right business model and the right time and all the other right things need to align, oftentimes years after they're supposed to align. It takes a very specific set of people who undertand the problem to go after it at a certain time. Even Google was the 35th search engine – we knew for sure that search engines would return crappy results and it would be impossible to make money on it.

As a founder, you almost always feel like you're too late, and you're almost always too early – you don't understand why it hasn't happened yet, and there must be 80 other people going after it. But the reality is you're almost always too early – a16z has never really seen any qualified founder fail because they were too late; usually it's the opposite. The Apple Newton was brought to market way too early, but 20 years later they brought out the iPad which finally worked.

*If what you're working on was hotly covered by press 3-4 years ago, you're probably starting the company at the right time.*

*Say you're 22 years old again. Where do you start?*

Marc would go find the best, hottest company in the Valley, the one that's growing the fastest and has the hottest culture for learning and training. This is a company like AirBnB.

*Before that?*

In college: focus on cryptocurrency, AI/machine learning/deep learning, the intersection of synthetic biology and genomics. All three are going to have transformative work done in the next 20 years.
