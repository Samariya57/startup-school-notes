## Pitch Practice with Sam Altman & Paul Buchheit

For companies that require non-ordinary domain knowledge, it's important to set the stage well – give the right context, give enough info so the investor understands the market you are trying to address.

At the end of a pitch, be sure to set the stage for a follow up – ask where you want to go from there, when to reconnect, etc.

It's very tempting to talk about all the different brilliant things you do, but the most important thing at an early stage is to be crystal clear what your product is, what you're building, so that the person you're pitching can understand what you do today. You may have a grandiose vision but it's important to focus on what your product does, who your customer is. Learn to reduce things to their essentials – it's the #1 skill of pitching you should practice.
