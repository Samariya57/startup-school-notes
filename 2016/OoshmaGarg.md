## Ooshma Garg – Founder, Gobble

**The Startup Curve:** A really exciting *Launch* often leads to a multi-year *Trough of Sorrow*. After pushing through the *Wiggles of False Hope*, if you have the stamina and the grit, maybe you will reach *The Promised Land*.

**Launch**

Started off as home-cooked meals between friends, which led to a spark and a mission statement: *To deliver home-cooked food to busy people*.

Raising seed money was accomplished through sheer persistence: numerous requests for a meeting with Keith Rabois initially led to nowhere, but eventually worked through multiple emails, a text message, and a last minute meeting. If you really want to meet someone, always tell them you're nearby or next door.

During the first few months after launch, the Gobble team tried many things that don't scale – even hand-written notes with flowers left at Palo Alto doors. However, something wasn't quite right – getting and keeping customers was proving extremely difficult.

**Torugh of Sorrow**

Enterprise catering led to revenue growth, but potential Series A investors clearly saw that although 80% of revenue was from enterprise, 100% of the vision was for consumers. They had all ambition, but lost vision, and no Series A materialized after a few months.

Macbeth: "I have no spur / To prick the sides of my intent, but only / Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself / And falls on th'other".

**Wiggles of False Hope**

Thinking more deeply about the vision, the team began choosing daily menus for consumers based on their tastes. This ended up being more profitable than anything they had tried before, but because at the same time many other food startups had entered the market, raising an A still proved to be difficult. The tech press was unforgiving: "Gobble was puttering about on the Peninsula with its paltry funding and ever-evolving business model."

At that point, Ooshma had the opportunity to join YC and took it, even as a post-seed company – it was either that or die, and it turned out to be an amazing experience.

It's always good to talk to your customers – Y Combinator tells you it helps you test and iterate your product, with the hope of finding product-market fit. Ooshma visited customers every week and found one more benefit: discovering her mission while doing it – *To create moments of love* through food.

**The Promised Land**

Once you find your mission, your north star, everything falls into place. Ambition is very singular; mission is shared.

Ambition is the strength to get through the Trough of Sorrow to get to product-market fit, but with just ambition, your initial key hires will leave at the first sign of trouble. Mission is something you share with your whole team to bring everyone through to the Promised Land.

Talking to customers led to the idea of a single-pan, 10-minute dinner kit – and it stuck. Users loved it, growth skyrocketed, and finally, their Series A materialized. Everything

**Takeaways**

*Grit* comes from your core. It is your ability to keep going, even when it hurts. Ooshma had many moments where she felt alone, but her mission and her team strengthened her through those times.  
*Experiment*. Many changes and many micro-learnings over many years.  
*Mission* will allow you to approach everything and everyone with the idea of giving.

Have *Grit* in your core, have *Experiments* in your head, have *Mission* in your heart, and you will be successful.
